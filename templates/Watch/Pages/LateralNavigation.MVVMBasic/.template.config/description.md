The lateral navigation pages are swiped to move the page.

Use lateral navigation to communicate information across individual screens so users can view them one by one.

Navigate screens by swiping right or left, or by rotating the bezel, and page indicators show which part of the content is currently being viewed. For more details, see [Navigation Design](https://developer.samsung.com/galaxy-watch/design/navigation).
