The sleep monitor tracks the user's sleep quality and it reports once per minute whether the user sleeps.

As this sensor usually needs to track the sleep quality over several hours, it must be power-efficient and work in a batch manner.

While the system sleeps, or the display is off, the sensor keeps its detected data internally
