This is a basic [Model-View-ViewModel pattern](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Model%E2%80%93view%E2%80%93viewmodel).

The Model-View-ViewModel (MVVM) is a design pattern to provide a separation of user interface development from business logic or back-end logic development.

The pattern defines a separation between three layers: the model, the view, and the view model.
