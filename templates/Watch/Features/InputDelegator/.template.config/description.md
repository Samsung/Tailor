Application Control is a way of sharing an application's functionality with other applications. Using another application's features through application controls reduces the time and effort needed to develop your own application. For more details about Application Control, see [Application Controls Guide](https://docs.tizen.org/application/dotnet/guides/app-management/app-controls/).

Various common functionalities are described in [Common Application Controls](https://docs.tizen.org/application/native/guides/app-management/common-appcontrols) and you can receive the user input using **Input Delegator** among them. So you don't need to provide any input method and your application just requests this functionality from the input delegator application. Then, the input delegator application receives user input instead and delivers it to your application. For more details how to make a request, see [Input Delegator Guide](https://docs.tizen.org/application/native/guides/app-management/common-appcontrols/#input-delegator).

If user selects recording type or drawing type, then input data may be stored in media storage. If so, your application needs to declare the privilege [http://tizen.org/privilege/mediastorage](https://docs.tizen.org/application/dotnet/tutorials/sec-privileges) and ask the user to grant that permission at runtime to access that input file. The feature **Shared Storage** will help you work more easily with media storage.
