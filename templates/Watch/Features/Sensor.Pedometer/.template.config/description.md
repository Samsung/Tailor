The pedometer detects the user's steps, and returns the number of steps taken by the user since the last reboot, while at least 1 application is using the pedometer.

The timestamp of the event denotes the time when the last step was taken.

In addition to the number of steps, it also returns other tracking data to further describe the user's activity status.
